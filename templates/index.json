For example, not every state allows an out-of-state salesperson to work on transactions unless the out-of-state broker/firm is involved.

All commissions for out-of-state salespeople must be disbursed to their home state broker.  This particular requirement is a function of the transaction state's licensing laws as well as the out-of-state salesperson's home state licensing laws.  Otherwise, the broker of record and the salesperson may be in violation of licensing laws - not only in the transaction state, but also in the salesperson's home state.</p>",
